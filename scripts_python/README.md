This folder contains the subfolders with the scripts focused on different tasks.
Note that each script was written to be executed from the root the repository.

Example with a training script :
```
python scripts/training/demnet_ADNI_wandb.py
```
(Usually I use the ipython interactive shell from the root of the repository. You could install the shell through the command `pip install ipython`)
